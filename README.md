# Introduction/Business Problem

The goal for the project is to find the best place for a new pub in Budapest. I will use the Foursquare API to solve the problem.
To find the best place it`s important to find the already existing places, which places are popular and if is there any room for a new business.

# Data

I will use the disticts of Budapest and parse all the coordinates from pages.
This page can be used to parse the GPS coordinates for all districts in Budapest: http://nepesseg.com/budapest/budapest-01-kerulet
